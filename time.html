          <p><strong> TRIALS SAFETY RULES</strong></p>
          <p>
            <em>We have adopted the rules the Sports Car Club of America</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Motorsports are dangerous. These Rules are in way a guarantee against injury or
            death to participants, spectators or others. You can reduce risk by
            driving well, properly using superior safety gear, attention, and
            reporting unsatisfactory issues to the event officials. Drivers are
            responsible ensuring the vehicle being used is properly prepared for
            operation under elevated acceleration, braking and cornering forces.
            Drivers must have a Inspection (Tech) Sheet completed and available
            to present to an Official.
          </p>
          <p>
            Entrants are reminded that is a considerable gap between a standard
            and the best protection that current technology can providE.  It is

            Safety 2 Standards. Vehicles with modified or fuel tanks and lines
            which run the cockpit will need to meet Safety Level 2 for driver
            clothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            All vehicles required meet Safety Level 2 Standards must meet the

          </p>
          <p><strong>2. Vehicle Equipment</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1. Bars</strong></p>
          <p>
            These specifications apply to all vehicles (other than those issued
            SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19). Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before
            1/1/19 may continue to compete with their previously approved
            rollover structure comply with the following specifications.
          </p>
          <p>
            A bar defined as a hoop and placed behind the driver and
            supplemented by two braces. The roll bar must be to withstand
            compression forces resulting from the weight of the car coming down
            on the roll structure, and to take fore-and-aft resulting car
            skidding along the ground on the roll structurE.  The basic purpose
            of the roll bar is to driver in the over. Roll bars must meet the
            criteria:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A. </strong>One length of must be for the member with smooth

            <strong>B. </strong>The top of the bar above the top of the
            driver&rsquo;s helmet when the driver is in normal driving position.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. </strong>The two (2) vertical members forming the of the
            must be than 15 inches (inside dimension), and it is desirable that
            it extend the full width of the cockpit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. </strong>An inspection hole of at least 3/16 inch diameter
            to of wall thickness may be requireD.  It must drilled a non-critical
            area of a roll bar member at least three from any weld or benD. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>E. </strong>All bolts nuts shall be SAE Grade 5 better,
            5/16-inch minimum diameter.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>F. </strong>Braces and portions of hoop subject to contact by
            the driver&rsquo;s passenger&rsquo;s helmet, seated normally and
            restrained by and harness, must be padded with a non- material such
            as Ethafoam&reg; or Ensolite&reg; or other similar material with a
            minimum thickness of 1/2 inch. Padding meeting spec 45.1 or
            8857-2001 is recommendeD. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>G.</strong>The size of tubing to be used for the main hoop,
            braces and diagonals shall be determined the basis of the weight the
            car. The following minimum are required and are based upon the
            weight of the without the driver. are nominal; 0.010-inch in wall
            thickness is alloweD.

            <strong>H.</strong>The roll bar hoop and all braces must be of
            seamless or DOM mild steel tubing (SAE 1010, 1020, 1025) or
            equivalent, or alloy tubing (SAE 4130). For logbooked before 1/1/16,
            existing ERW tubing is acceptablE. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>I.</strong>All should be highest quality full penetration.
            Craters be filled to the cross section of weld and undercut no than
            0.01 inch deep.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>J.</strong>All roll bars must be braced in a manner to
            prevent movement in a fore-and- direction with the braces attached
            the top third of the roll hoop. At a minimum, two (2) braces must be
            used, parallel to the sides of the car, and placed at outer
            extremities of the roll bar hoop. Such braces should extend to the
            rear possiblE.  Diagonal lateral bracing be installed to prevent
            distortion of the hoop. In most cases, a lateral brace from the
            bottom corner of the hoop on the side to the top corner of the hoop
            on the other side sufficient. Although installing the diagonal
            lateral brace in the main hoop is the strongest alternative (and
            preferable), there may be instances where such installation is not
            practical. In such situations, installation of the diagonal brace
            from the bottom of the fore/aft brace on one side the top corner the
            hoop on the other side is acceptablE.  convertible vehicles with a
            production beginning 1990 later, as Mazda Miata, a &ldquo;V&rdquo;
            design, also known as a &ldquo; diagonal&rdquo; between the rear
            supports is acceptablE. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>K.</strong>Removable roll bars and braces must be carefully
            designed and to be at least as strong as a permanent installation.
            If one (1) tube fits inside another tube to facilitate removal,
            removable portion fit tightly and must bottom on the permanent
            mounting, and least two (2) bolts be used to each telescope section.
            The telescope section be at least eight inches in length. One (1)
            bolt is if one (1) end is welded to the hoop.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>L.</strong>Roll bars and braces must be attached to the
            frame of the car wherever possiblE.  Mounting plates may be used
            purpose where desireD. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>M.</strong>In case of cars unitized or frameless
            construction, mounting plates may used to secure the bar structure
            to the car floor. The important consideration is that the load be
            over as an area as possiblE.  A backing plate of equal size thickness
            must be used on the opposite side the with the plates through-
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>N.</strong>Mounting plates bolted the structure not be less
            0.1875 inch thick and the use a back-up plate of equal size and
            thickness on the opposite side the panel with plates through-bolted
            together is recommendeD.  A minimum three (3) bolts per plate is
            required for bolted plates.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>O.</strong> plates welded to structure shall not be less
            than 0.080 inch thick. Whenever possible, the mounting plate should
            extend onto a vertical section of the structure, such as a door
            pillar.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2. Seats</strong></p>
          <p>
            It is highly recommended that the driver&rsquo;s seat be replaced
            with a one-piece, bucket-type race seat. If used, the one-piece,
            bucket-type race seat shall be securely mounted and fore/aft and
            lateral support.

          <p><strong>3. SAFETY LEVEL 3</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1. Overview</strong></p>
          <p>
            is intended that Safety Level 3 be similar to that of SCCA Road
            Racing. Vehicles of motorsports-specific construction are required
            to meet these specifications. For National Time Trial Events,
            vehicles prepared beyond Max Category Rules and competing on tires
            without DOT-Approval must meet Safety Level 3 Standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            3 vehicles must meet the requirements of Safety Levels 1 and 2, the
            of a roll cage compliant with specifications listed herE.  A roll
            cage consists of main hoop, front hoop, side protection, and braces
            as specified these Rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            These specifications apply to all vehicles an SCCA before 1/1/19.
            Cars issued an SCCA Logbook before 1/1/19 may continue to their
            previously rollover structure or comply with the following
            specifications.

          <p><strong>2. Cages</strong></p>
          <p><strong>1. Main Hoop</strong></p>
          <p>
            The main hoop (behind the driver) must be width of the for all cars.
            must be continuous length of tubing with smooth and no evidence
            crimping or wall failurE.  The main maintain a single planE. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A. </strong> all closed cars, the must be as close as
            possible to the and &ldquo;B&rdquo; pillars.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. </strong>On open cars retaining windshield frame, the hoop
            full height for the entire width of the hoop. The top of the main
            hoop must be at least 2 above the driver&rsquo;s helmet.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. </strong>Open cars without the windshield use an
            asymmetric main hoop. The main hoop be full width to the passenger
            side of the car. On the passenger side of the car, the hoop must be
            at least as high as the top the rear corner of the door. The main
            hoop be high enough that a straight line drawn the top of the hoop
            to the top the hoop would over the driver&rsquo;s helmet and
            steering wheel when the driver is seated in the driving position.
            Additionally, the top the main hoop must be at least 2 inches above
            the driver&rsquo;s helmet.
          </p>
          <p><strong>2. Main Hoop Bracing</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>A. </strong>Main hoops shall incorporate a diagonal bracE. 
            brace shall either be in the plane of the hoop or extend from the
            top of one rear brace to the bottom of the opposite rear bracE. 
            Automobiles with mid-mounted engines can have lower mounting point
            attach to the frame the automobile within 6 inches of the main hoop.
            In the case of braces in the plane of the main hoop, the brace span
            at least 50% of the of main hoop, and at least 75% the height of the
            hoop. In convertible vehicles with a production line 1990 or later,
            such as the Mazda Miata, a &ldquo;V&rdquo; design, also known a
            &ldquo;double diagonal&rdquo; used between the rear supports is
            acceptablE. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. </strong>Cars must incorporate a hoop horizontal brace at
            the approximate level the driver&rsquo;s shoulders but not lower
            than shoulder mounting point as describeD.  If a double-diagonal
            &ldquo;X&rdquo; brace is used in the plane of hoop, a half-width
            horizontal brace may be used behind the driver&rsquo;s seat to mount
            seat back and shoulder harness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. </strong>Cars must have two (2) braces to the the and
            attaching the frame or chassis. Braces be attached as near as
            possible to the top of the main hoop (not than 6 inches below top),
            and at included angle of at least 30 degrees.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. </strong>Open cars must have two (2) braces extending
            forward from the main hoop and attaching to the front hoop, not more
            than 6 inches below the top the front and hoop. It is recommended
            that the front rear braces attach to the main as close as possible
            to each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>E. </strong> cars where the rear window/bulkhead prohibits
            the installation of rear braces (E. g., Honda del Sol), the main hoop
            shall attached the body by plates welded the cage and bolted to
            harness mounting points. installation design must incorporate a
            diagonal bar connecting the top the hoop to the lower front
            passenger side (Petty bar). Alternatively, rear window may be
            removed and a clear, LEXAN&trade; installeD.  The cage may pass
            through this replacement window and through the cover or bodywork to
            allow connection to the frame or unibody.
          </p>
          <p><strong>3. Hoop</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>A. </strong>Roll cages may be of two designs, low front hoop
            or high front hoop. All closed-top cars and cars the must have a
            high hoop design. Open cars may incorporate a high or low front hoop
            design. High front hoops referred to as side hoops.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1.</strong>Closed cars: The front hoop (side hoop) must
            follow the line of the A-pillars to the top of windshield and be
            connected by horizontal bars to the top of main hoop on side (as
            close to the roof possible). Instead a single front hoop, side hoops
            (down tubes) may be useD.  Alternatively, a top &ldquo;halo&rdquo;
            hoop following the roof line the to the windshield with forward down
            tubes following the A-pillars to the floor may useD.  of which one of
            the approved configurations, shall be a tube connecting the A-pillar
            at the top of windshielD. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2.</strong>Open cars: The height of the front hoop must be
            consistent across the full width of the cockpit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B.  Front Hoop Bracing</strong><br />All cars with a high
            front and all tube frame cars must incorporate a horizontal front
            hoop brace at approximate level of the dashboarD.  It is recommended
            production-chassis cars also have front hoop bracE. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1.</strong>One tube may extend, from front down tube,
            forward to the firewall or for or SCCA GCR-class through the
            firewall. In this case it is this tube, one each side, to the
            chassis a point not more 12 inches forward the front axle
            centerlinE. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>4. Side Protection</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>A. </strong> tubes connecting the front and main across both
            door openings are strongly recommendeD.  Tubes that welded to any
            part of same mounting plate considered to be connected to another.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. </strong>NASCAR- side protection bar bisecting another
            form an &ldquo;X&rdquo; is permitteD.  Door side may extend into the
            door.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1.</strong>Door glass, window operating mechanism, inner
            door trim panel, armrest, pockets, wiring harnesses for door locks,
            windows, power mirrors, seat wiring, etC. , and inside door
            latch/lock operating mechanism may and the inner door structural
            panel may be modifieD. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2.</strong>The stock outside door latch/lock mechanism shall
            not be removed or modified unless specifically authorized the Rules.
          </p>
          <p><strong>5. Cage Attachment Points</strong></p>

          </p>
          <p><strong>7. Basic Design Consideration</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>A. </strong> of the roll cage subject to contact the driver
            must be padded with a 1 of material. Padding that meets or exceeds
            SFI 45.1 FIA 8857-2001 (curved padding), or SFI 45.2 sports car rest
            material ( padding) specification recommendeD. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. </strong> portion of the roll cage may an aerodynamic
            effect by creating a vertical forcE. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>C. </strong>The all in the roll cage ( at centerline tubing)
            must not less than times the of the tubing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>D. </strong>It is recommended that all joints of roll cage
            weldeD.  All include full penetration, no lap, no surface porosity,
            no crater porosity, cracks, whiskers, so forth. continuous around
            the tubular structurE.  Procedures for welding alloy shall be in
            accordance with accepted industry practicE.  It is recommended that a
            AWS D1.1 welder all welding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>E. </strong>It is recommended that gussets be used at all
            joints.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>F. </strong>Any number of additional tube is permitted within
            the boundaries of cage structurE.  Such tube elements may pass
            through any or optional bulkhead or panel separating the
            driver/passenger compartment the trunk/cargo area/fuel tank/fuel
            cell provided the bulkhead is sealed such tube elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>G.</strong>Removable roll cage bracing is acceptable in of
            the following configurations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1.</strong>If one tube fits inside another tube to
            facilitate removal, the removable portion must fit tightly and
            bottom by design, and at least two (2) must used to secure each
            joint. The telescoping section must be at least 8 inches long. The
            diameter is 3/8 inch.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2.</strong>Removable may incorporate connectors of the
            double-lug, double ear-type, tapered or muff-typE.  The double-lug
            type must include a doubler, gusset, or capping to avoid distortion
            or excessive strain caused by welding. Double ear-type joints must
            fully welded at all the surfaces.
          </p>

            <strong>8. Manufacturer Supplied/FIA/MSA Homologated Cages</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A. </strong>Cars may compete with FIA or FIA-Approved Test
            Houses homologated cages provided the cage was built by the
            manufacturer or a manufacturer designated shop/team and approved for
            usE.  Cars have the FIA identification plate to cage with a letter
            from SCCA Technical Services certifying the origins of the car, or
            confirmation that the cage was certified by an FIA- Test HousE. 
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>B. </strong>Cars may compete with an MSA (Motor Sports UK)
            Roll Over Protection System CertificatE.  All engineering drawings
            and documents shall be SCCA Technical Services. Cars must have MSA
            identification plate attached to the cage along with a from SCCA
            Technical Services cage was approved by the MSA.
